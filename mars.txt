Mars is the red planet.  Named for the Roman god of War, it has never actually declared conflict against planet Earth, at least as far as we know.
Cold and dry, but everything is my favourite colour.
The two moons may be a problem for Wolfman.  Wolfman has reported his severe lunaphobia to me on numerous occasions.
The Mummy will like the dryness.  She finds it excellent for making her meringues crisp.
